        <span>F</span>ew cities can claim such a priceless art and history
        heritage as Venice. This unique city with its magical, spectacular scenery
        is not just beautiful; it is a real miracle of creative genius: a city
        built on mud, sand and the slime of a difficult, inhospitable landscape.
        The biggest attraction in the gorgeous city of Venice is the
        architecture — which is enhanced by the ancient canals that surround it.
        As well as Piazza San Marco and St. Mark’s Basilica, the city is home to
        the Gothic masterpiece Doge’s Palace. This pink and white marble buildings
        has to be seen in the flesh to be fully appreciated. Not only is it a
        breathtaking example of Italian architecture, it is also the centre of
        Venice Carnival celebrations every year. Just a short gondola ride from
        Doge’s Palace is the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, which is one of the
        world’s most illustrious modern art collections. If you’re looking for
        more traditional works from the Renaissance period, spend some time at the
        Galleria dell’Accademia, which houses several classics from this era.

        There are many places in Venice which characterise the city’s illustrious
        history and association with the arts and architecture. Take the Bridge
        of Sighs, for example, which is a white limestone masterpiece that the
        interrogation rooms of Doge’s Palace to the prison. But the most beautiful
        bridge in all of Venice has to be the Rialto Bridge. This ornate structure
        hangs over the Grand Canal with masterful confidence. Connecting San Polo
        to the sestieri of San Marco, the bridge has been rebuilt many times over the years.
        If you’re looking for entertainment in Venice, you truly are spoilt for
        choice. Spend a few hours perusing the artworks at Museo Correr, or explore
        an exciting mix of Renaissance and modern art at Punta della Dogana.
        Perhaps you'd prefer to take in an evening of ballet or live music at
        Teatro La Fenice, which is a truly magnificent 1000-seat theatre.
        If you're interested in the history of Venice, a trip to either the Lace
        Museum or Fortuny Museum will take you on a journey of discovery. And no
        trip to Venice should pass by without a trip to Ca’ d’Oro — a Venetian-Gothic
        palace that also happens to be home to the Franchetti collection of Renaissance art.
